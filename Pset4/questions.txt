2.  Lossy compression refers to the loss in quality of an image as it is compresses and decompressed.
    Lossless compression corresponds to the retiontion of image quality in its entirety even when the image is compressed or decompressed any number of times.

4.  When a file is deleted in FAT system, metadata that is pointed to that file is rewritten while disk 
    blocks containing the file's content are still there.
5.  I would use a data destruction software that would over-write the disk so many times that it would 
    be nearly impossible to recover the data.
6.  <stdint.h> is a header file located in the C standard Library which "allow programmers to write more 
    portable code by providing a set of typedefs,that narrow down specific typedefs in exact-integer types.
7.  These are predefined signed TYPES for specific number usage
8.  BYTE = 8-bit = 1 byte, 
    DWORD = 32-bit = 4 bytes
    LONG = 32-bit = 4 bytes
    WORD = 16-bit = 2 bytes
9.  Signature letters BM with hexadecimal value (0x42 0x4D)
10. bfSize refers to the file size of the bitmap in bytes.
    biSize refers to the header size which must be be at least 40 bytes.
11. If biHeight is negative, it indicates that the pixel data is ordered from top-down  and the origin of the bitmap is the upper-left corner.
12. The biBitCount field specifies the BMP's color depth.
13. fopen may return NULL value when either of the two occurs:
    a)file is too large and there is not enough space. 
    b)user is not authorized to create the file.
14. The third argument to fread takes in the size of the bitmapfile header and each bitmap image comes with only one header.
15. 1
16. The fseek() function is used to change the file postion of the stream
17. Used as an argument for fseek(); shows the position of the postion pointer
18. It is ROB BOWDEN and his CAT
